# AFD-Chat-Server
A simple chat server. A minimalist GUI client is included

## How to use
First, run the server python script. Then you can connect to it via the C# client. Each user can connect to the server by entering server's IP and a nickname

## Disclaimer
This is just a demo I wrote a few years ago and is in no way meant to be deployed on a production server
